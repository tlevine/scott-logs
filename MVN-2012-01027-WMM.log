Thatdecision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of importantresources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must bebalanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the\fproposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those areconservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historicproperties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energyneeds, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownershipand, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and localagencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider andevaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by theCorps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for thisproposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interestfactors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessmentand/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overallpublic interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposedwork. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknownarcheological, scientific, prehistorical, or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are beingsent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed asendangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to thesurvival and recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of theMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal wouldresult in the destruction or alteration of n/a acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of reddrum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have asubstantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our finaldetermination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to reviewby and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established bythe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposedactivity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Departmentof Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice,that a public hearing be held to consider this application.
