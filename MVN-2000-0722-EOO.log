The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of 0.67 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of theprobable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable\f-3water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water QualityCertifications, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearingbe held to consider this application.
