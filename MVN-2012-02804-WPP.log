There are 4.1 acres of impacts to wetlands proposed through project constructionwhich will be mitigated through a mitigation plan approved by the Corps and the Resource Agencies.LOCATION: Point of Beginning Lat. 29.52622, Long. -90.52053, Point of Ending Lat. 29.55436, Long.-90.52731, South of Louisiana Highway 24, near Larose, Louisiana, in Lafourche Parish.

Writtencomments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasonsthereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and mustbe mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning theCorps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application\f-2Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORYBRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's nameand the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Qualityat the address above.The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of EnvironmentalQuality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtainedupon payment of costs of reproduction.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant tothe National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the StateArcheologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered bythe U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survivaland recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of 4.1 acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impacton EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to projectimpacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NationalMarine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluationof the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate\f-3applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Officeof Water Resources before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a publichearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, thereasons for holding a public hearing.You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whomyou deem likely to have interest in the matter.The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with andwill be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.
