The benefit, whichreasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonablyforeseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered includingthe cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, generalenvironmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplainvalues, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of propertyownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. Tomake this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Commentsare used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statementpursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for apublic hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.Three sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.

Approximately2150 cubic yards of concrete/rip rap will be placed on-site. The proposed activity would impactapproximately 1 acre of forested wetland and 1 acre of herbaceous wetland. To compensate forunavoidable wetland impacts, the applicant proposes to purchase credits from a Corps approvedmitigation bank located within the watershed. Work will be performed as shown in the encloseddrawings.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of\f- 2 Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Writtencomments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasonsthereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and mustbe mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning theCorps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit ApplicationNumber, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION:REGULATORY BRANCH. Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference theapplicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality at the address above.The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of EnvironmentalQuality and may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained uponpayment of costs of reproduction.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflectthe national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, whichreasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonablyforeseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered includingthe cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, generalenvironmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplainvalues, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of propertyownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. Tomake this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Commentsare used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statementpursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for apublic hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.Three sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the StateArcheologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) is known to occur in the Mississippi River and and isbelieved to spawn in Louisiana. Our initial finding is that the proposed work would not adversely affectthe pallid sturgeon, would not affect any other species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments ofInterior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of anyendangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse\f- 3 impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative toproject impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with theNational Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,Office of Environmental Servicesbefore a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a publichearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,the reasons for holding a public hearing.You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other partieswhom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with andwill be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.
