Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have asubstantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our finaldetermination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to reviewby and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposedactivity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department ofEnvironmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
