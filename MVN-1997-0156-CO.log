Tomake this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Commentsare used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statementpursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for apublic hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
