Additional details of the proposed restoration plan are attached for review inthe mitigation banking prospectus.The comment period will close 30 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.\f-2Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed tothe above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impactincluding cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.

Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantialadverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our finaldetermination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject toreview by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.\f-3-If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposedactivity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the LouisianaDepartment of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
