That decision will reflectthe national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, whichreasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonablyforeseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered includingthe cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, generalenvironmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplainvalues, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of propertyownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. Tomake this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Commentsare used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statementpursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for apublic hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.

Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverseimpact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative toproject impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with theNational Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
