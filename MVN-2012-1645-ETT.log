The applicant has agreed tocomply with US Fish and Wildlife’s (FWS) “Standard Manatee Conditions for In-water Work” of 2009;therefore, the Corps’ preliminary determination is that the project as proposed “may affect, but is notlikely to adversely affect” the manatee. By this public notice the Corps is requesting concurrence from theFWS for that determination.The project site is located in an area designated as “critical habitat” for the Gulf sturgeon(Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) an ESA listed species. Although the project will result in temporaryadverse impacts to the sturgeon’s critical habitat, upon completion the project will provide improvedessential fish habitat and critical habitat for the sturgeon long term. All proposed dredging will beconducted with hydraulic cutter-suction head dredge. No hopper dredging is proposed therefore, theCorps’ preliminary determination is that the project “may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect” theGulf sturgeon and its critical habitat and will seek concurrence from the NMFS, with that determination,via separate correspondence. The Corps is unaware of any other ESA listed species or of any other ESAdesignated critical habitat that may be affected by this project.This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation and Management Act.

To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of HistoricPlaces at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage ordestroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of thisnotice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.\f3The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is known to occur in Lake Pontchartrain. Theproject’s in-water work will last for approximately nine to ten months. The applicant has agreed tocomply with US Fish and Wildlife’s (FWS) “Standard Manatee Conditions for In-water Work” of 2009;therefore, the Corps’ preliminary determination is that the project as proposed “may affect, but is notlikely to adversely affect” the manatee. By this public notice the Corps is requesting concurrence from theFWS for that determination.The project site is located in an area designated as “critical habitat” for the Gulf sturgeon(Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) an ESA listed species. Although the project will result in temporaryadverse impacts to the sturgeon’s critical habitat, upon completion the project will provide improvedessential fish habitat and critical habitat for the sturgeon long term. All proposed dredging will beconducted with hydraulic cutter-suction head dredge. No hopper dredging is proposed therefore, theCorps’ preliminary determination is that the project “may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect” theGulf sturgeon and its critical habitat and will seek concurrence from the NMFS, with that determination,via separate correspondence. The Corps is unaware of any other ESA listed species or of any other ESAdesignated critical habitat that may be affected by this project.This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in temporary impacts to +331 acres ofEFH and the nourishment and creation of +2,089 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum,blue crab and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed actions may have atemporary adverse impact on EFH but the long term effects that would be derived upon projectcompletion will be beneficial for EFH and federally managed fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico. Our finaldetermination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by andcoordination with the NMFS.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, withparticularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.\f4You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other partieswhom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.Attachments\f","locationOfWork":"","WQC":"130124-03"}
