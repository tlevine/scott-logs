Bay Marchand-SouthTimbalier Reservoir Grade Three Dimensional seismic survey. The original 3-D seismic survey coveredapproximately 276 square miles, of which approximately 95 square miles of the seismic survey are locatedinland and out to the State-Federal waters boundary line and approximately 181 square miles of theproject are located in federal waters. The first expansion of the project covered approximately 83.076square miles located within Timbalier Bay inside State waters.The currently proposed modification incorporates an additional 146.029-square mile area located to theeast of the existing seismic survey area. The additional area is located in the waters of Jefferson andPlaquemines Parishes, in the open waters south of Grand Isle, Louisiana. Approximately 77.802 squaremiles of the project are located in Federal waters and outside of the Corps’ section 10 jurisdiction.Approximately 68.227 square miles are located within the Corps’ jurisdiction and inside State waters.The purpose of this survey is to provide a high-resolution image of the subsurface geological features toevaluate potential hydrocarbon reserves underlying the project area. The entire proposed expansion areawill be located in the Gulf of Mexico. Ocean Bottom Cables (OBC) will be placed on the gulf floor withspacing between receiver lines of 1,640 feet and connected to the recording vessel (Jack-Up Rig) locatedin State and Federal waters. The survey design will incorporate air gun energy sources (no explosives willbe used), which will be shot at 164 foot intervals in the Gulf of Mexico. In open water, there will beapproximately 656.2 feet between source lines. The attached maps show the location of the project area,as well as source and receiver point locations.\fThe comment period for the Department of the Army Permit will close 15 days from the date ofthis public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to theproposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit mustbe mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning theCorps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit ApplicationNumber, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORYBRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposedwork by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public noticegrid on the web page. Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requestedextension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chiefwill review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny therequest. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive ofthe initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the StateArcheologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would occur in areas that are utilized by theendangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle (Lepidocheyls kempii), Hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmocheylysimbricate), and Leatherback sea turtle (Dermocheylys coriacea), and the threatened Green sea turtle(Chelonia mydas), and Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta).This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of 43,665 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impacton EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to projectimpacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NationalMarine Fisheries Service.\fAny person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, withparticularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies withand will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. TheDepartment of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver ofthe Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other partieswhom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.JOHN M.
