The dredging operation will consist of the removal of approximately 5,550 cubic yards of materialwhich will be deposited in an existing spoil disposal area, as shown on the drawings. Approximately 0.5 acre of“other waters of the United States” will be affected by the proposed project.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of EnvironmentalQuality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.
