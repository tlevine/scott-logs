Permit modification request proposes anexpansion of operations over an approximate 59.1-acre parcel to tie into the previously authorizedClemmons South aggregate mine. The total project area incorporating the proposed expansion wouldmeasure approximately 213.74 acres, of which approximately 185.90 acres would be affected directly bymining and or clearing activities. Approximately 3.27 acres of jurisdictional forested wetlands would beimpacted by the proposed expansion, of which approximately 1.03 acres of forested wetlands were clearedwithout a Department of the Army permit. Approximately 0.15 acre of wetlands has been cleared as aresult of silviculture operations and self restoration has been agreed upon by the Corps’ Surveillance andEnforcement Section (OD-SS). Approximately 0.12 acre of wetlands has been cleared without a permitand OD-SS has accepted a restoration plan incorporating replanting and monitoring measures.Approximately 17.97 acres of jurisdictional wetlands will be avoided and not directly impacted by the\fproposed expansion of mining operations. For the unavoidable impacts to 3.27 acres of jurisdictionalwetlands, the applicant is proposing to contract with an appropriate mitigation bank to purchase mitigationcredits.The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to pre-project conditions, ifissuance of a permit is determined to be contrary to the overall public interestThe comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.

That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the StateArcheologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.\fOur initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangeredby the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to thesurvival and recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of NA acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impacton EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to projectimpacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NationalMarine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
