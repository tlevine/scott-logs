Once the material has dewatered and compacted, the applicant proposes to plantmarsh vegetation on site, including: California bulrush, needlegrass rush, smooth cordgrass, bigcordgrass, pickerelweed, bulltongue arrowhead, and common reed. Plant stock will depend onavailability. A marsh buggy excavator will be utilized to access, establish, and degradecontainment areas. The dredge site and fill areas have access via existing roads and levees.The PRM proposes a design life of 20 years, which includes performance standards for years 1,3, and 5. Monitoring reports will be required every 2 years until the final success criterion is\f-2met. The applicant proposes to establish a Construction and Establishment financial assurance toensure construction and long term maintenance.A PRM for this work was considered ecologically preferable to a mitigation bank due to theproximity of impacts. The Modified Charleston Method (MCM) was used to determine the PRMrequirements. The 8.1 acres of unavoidable impacts for MVN-2011-1995-EOO required a 16acre restoration area. The 2.7 acres of unavoidable impacts for MVN-2011-1974-EOO requireda 5 acre restoration area.The comment period will close 20 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,stating reasons therefore, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.Letters must reference the applicant’s name and the subject number, be addressed and mailed tothe above address, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.

Thatdecision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of importantresources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must bebalanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to theproposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those areconservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historicproperties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energyneeds, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownershipand, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to considerand evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be consideredby the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or denya permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts onendangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and otherpublic interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an EnvironmentalAssessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.\f-3No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknownarcheological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are beingsent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed asendangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designatedas critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of theMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal wouldresult in the destruction or alteration of up to 21 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages ofred drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would nothave a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures issubject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposedactivity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department ofEnvironmental Quality, Water Quality Certifications Section before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
