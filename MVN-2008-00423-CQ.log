The previous projectproposed to directly impact approximately 78.6 acres of wetlands. The proposed project has beenreconfigured to minimize direct impacts to onsite wetlands. Additionally, a request to modify thejurisdictional determination to possibly reflect a reduction in jurisdictional areas onsite has also beenproposed and is currently in review.The applicant has requested Department of the Army authorization to implement the AmericanaTraditional Neighborhood Development (TND). The proposed TND will consist of residential housing,shopping centers, health car facilities, grocery stores, offices, and other amenities to meet the needs ofresidents. The TND will include 1,765 housing units of various types: single-detached homes,townhouses, condominiums, live and work unites, and homes for senior citizens. Approximately 520,000square feet of commercial and retail establishments are proposed with the project which includes: an\findoor commercial amusement facility, a 60,000 square foot grocery store, a movie theater, a YMCA, acivic building, and other appurtenances. Approximately 98.55 acres of potentially jurisdictional wetlandsand approximately 4.3 acres of Other Waters of the U.S. are located on the 417.37-acre site.Approximately 10.13 acres of potentially jurisdictional forested wetlands and approximately 4.3 acres ofOther Waters of the U.S. are to be directly impacted via fill placement as a result of projectimplementation. There is a pending jurisdictional determination request awaiting verification. If theproject is found to impact additional wetland/OWOUS acreage(s), an addendum incorporating theappropriate additions to this public notice will be advertised. Approximately 21,473 cubic yards of fillmaterial will be placed onsite as a result of project implementation. The applicant proposes to contractwith an approved compensatory mitigation bank to offset impacts associated with the project.The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to pre-project conditions, ifissuance of a permit is determined to be contrary to the overall public interestThe comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.

That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments.

That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public\fhearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the StateArcheologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangeredby the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to thesurvival and recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of NA acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impacton EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to projectimpacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NationalMarine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
