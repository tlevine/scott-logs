In addition, the existing pedestrian access and trash barrier will be removed and replaced atthe structure.South Structure: Approximately 6,539 cubic yards of material will be dredged (1.47 acres) within the 98-footwide inlet and temporarily placed on the northernmost stream bank for sluice gate removal. An existingmooring dolphin will be removed and the existing trash barrier will be removed and replaced at the structure.Project implementation will impact 1.40 acres of scrub-shrub jurisdictional wetlands and 2.03 acres of nonvegetated waterbottoms. This project is proposed to be beneficial in nature, allowing unimpeded flows from theMississippi River into the westernmost bayous/bays of Breton Sound. The spoil areas are a temporary impact.After construction, spoil areas will be degraded to pre-project elevations with dredged material placed back intothe channels. The applicant has requested allowing 1-year growing season to assess mitigation impacts.\f-2The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are beingsolicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to bereceived before or by the last day of the comment period.

Similar letters concerningthe Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application numberand be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Qualityand may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained uponpayment of costs of reproduction.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, includingcumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the nationalconcern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may beexpected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factorswhich may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among thoseare conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish andwildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agenciesand officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of thisproposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers todetermine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, generalenvironmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation ofan Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibilityexists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State HistoricPreservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed asendangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to thesurvival and recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-StevensFishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.\f-3If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of theprobable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicablewater quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water QualityCertifications, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearingbe held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons forholding a public hearing.The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will beconducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.
