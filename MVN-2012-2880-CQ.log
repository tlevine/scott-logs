The degrading swamp is slowly converting from freshwaterswamp habitat to freshwater marsh habitat and open water areas. The proposed ecosystem restorationproject of the western Maurepas swamp is located north of the Amite River Diversion Canal and west ofthe Blind River. The project proposes to restore approximately 1,600 acres of forested freshwater swamphabitat through improved hydrologic connectivity, reduced impoundment, and vegetative plantings. Theproject entails the gapping of the northern spoil bank of the Amite River Diversion Canal and dredgingconveyance channels within portions of the adjacent forested swamp wetlands. The dredged materialwould be placed within the project Right-Of-Way (ROW) as shown on the attached drawings. The ROWspoil placement areas are to be planted to create additional freshwater swamp or bottomland hardwoodhabitats. Dredged spoil material will be spaced to maintain connectivity between the conveyance channelsand the surrounding swamp. Approximately 69,260 cubic yards of material would be dredged for theconstruction of the three conveyance channels, the three gaps in the spoil bank, and the gap in theabandoned railroad grade. Approximately 69,260 cubic yards of dredged material would be placed as fillmaterial within the 48-acre ROW. Approximately 20.4 acres would be impacted directly from dredging","locationOfWork":"LOCATION OF WORK: In Sections 25, 26, 27, 30, 35, & 36, Township 9 South, Ranges 5 & 6 East,located approximately six miles east of the intersection of LA Highway 22 and Homes Port Drive, alongthe northern spoil bank of the Amite River Diversion Canal, near Maurepas, Louisiana, in LIVINGSTONPAMSH, 30.22702 N and -90.67206 W, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
