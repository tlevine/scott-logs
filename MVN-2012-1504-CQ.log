The applicant is proposing to place approximately 175 cubic yards of rip rap concretematerial to help prevent further erosion to his lot. Approximately 3.5 yards of concrete will be used in theboat launch construction. Boat launch measures approximately 10’ wide x 20’ long x 4” thick base. Theboat lift/shed and deck totals approximately 44-linear feet in width along the shoreline and will extendchannelward approximately 20 feet. The total length from the applicant’s current shoreline to thecenterline of the Amite River channel is approximately 165 feet. Approximately 18 treated pilings will beinstalled for the deck and boat slip construction. Approximately 0.002 acre of waterbottoms would beimpacted by concrete fill for boat launch construction. Approximately 0.038 acre of waterbottoms wouldbe impacted by rip rap placement along the 330 linear feet of the existing shoreline.
