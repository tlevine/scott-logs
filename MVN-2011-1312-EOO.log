The proposed road base follows an existing dirt road andextends 14,532 feet long and 60 feet wide. Project implementation would require approximately 32,292 cubicyards of onsite soils to be excavated and hauled to a non-wetland location, and 18,756 cubic yards of sandyclay, 16,146 cubic yards of crushed limestone, and 5,920 cubic yards of asphalt hauled-in and deposited for theroad bed. The road right-of-way would directly impact 20.23 acres, of which, approximately 1.25 acres are pineflatwood/savannah wetlands. The applicant proposes to contract with an approved compensatory mitigationbank to offset impacts associated with the project.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.

That decision will reflect the nationalconcern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may beexpected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. Allfactors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historicproperties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion andaccretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiberproduction, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of thepeople.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agenciesand officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of thisproposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers todetermine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, generalenvironmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation ofan Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibilityexists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State HistoricPreservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect the Louisiana Quillwort(Isoetes louisianensis), Gopher Tourtoise (Gopherus polyphemus), and Red-Cockaded Woodpecker (Picoidesborealis) based on the attached threatened and endangered species survey. Concurrence for this determination isrequested via an informal consultation with US Fish and Wildlife Service.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-StevensFishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency.

The proposed road base follows an existing dirt road andextends 14,532 feet long and 60 feet wide. Project implementation would require approximately 32,292 cubicyards of onsite soils to be excavated and hauled to a non-wetland location, and 18,756 cubic yards of sandyclay, 16,146 cubic yards of crushed limestone, and 5,920 cubic yards of asphalt hauled-in and deposited for theroad bed. The road right-of-way would directly impact 20.23 acres, of which, approximately 1.25 acres are pineflatwood/savannah wetlands. The applicant proposes to contract with an approved compensatory mitigationbank to offset impacts associated with the project.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.
