A time extension and modification to the previouslyauthorized permit’s onsite mitigation plan have been requested. The permittee is requesting additionaltime to complete the onsite restoration areas and also modify the previously authorized permit andrestoration footprint (authorized April 3, 2000, extended 12/1/2004; with expiration date of February 28,2008). All work has been completed in accordance with the attached drawings. The permittee isrequesting that the original mitigation plan be modified to reflect the final constructed footprint of theproject site. The original permit was authorized to directly impact approximately 7.5 acres ofjurisdictional forested wetlands and approximately 0.5 acre of Other Waters of the U.S. The permit’soriginal mitigation plan (affixed to the permit and referenced in the permit’s special condition number 9)called for restoration of 9.5 acres of mixed pine bottomland hardwood habitat, the creation of 5.6 acres ofmixed pine bottomland hardwood habitat, and the enhancement of 5.5 acres of mixed pine bottomlandhardwood habitat. The permittee has requested that this plan be changed to reflect the reduced number ofwetland acreage being impacted as a result of the project. The permittee has claimed that the during theextraction processes, the vein deposit of sand became unproductive; therefore, stopping the extractionprocess resulted in the impact of approximately 3.5 acres of jurisdictional wetlands. The permittee isproposing to leave two areas of forested habitat undisturbed (3.97 acres and 4.29 acres, as depicted in the\fattached drawings), a fill area totaling 5.79 acres to be replanted with appropriate mixed pine bottomlandhardwood species, and an additional area totaling approximately 3.0 acres that was created by pushingclay piles into the shallow water areas of the remnant dredge pond.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Writtencomments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasonsthereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and mustbe mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period.

Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.
