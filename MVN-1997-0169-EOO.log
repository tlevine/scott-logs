The redevelopment would include removing theexisting boat slips, boat launch, piers, and shoreline for greenspace, a concrete area with newamenities/buildings, and multiple boat slips (28 - 12.5’ by 35’, 24 – 20’ by 40’, and 4 – 24’ by 73’ slips).Project implementation would result in excavating 23,393 cubic yards of material with 22,233 cubic yards to beplaced on-site and within the existing marina rip-rap. The remaining 1,160 cubic yards would be hauled off to anon-wetland location. The remaining channel would be dredged to 8’ deep for marine vessels ranging from 20’to 90’.The 0.7 acres of jurisdictional wetlands proposed for impact is compensatory mitigation for the previouspermit. The agent maintains that these unavoidable wetland impacts would be compensated through thepurchase of credits from an approved mitigation bank within the same hydrologic basin.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.

That decision will reflect the nationalconcern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may beexpected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. Allfactors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historicproperties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion andaccretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiberproduction, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of thepeople.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agenciesand officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of thisproposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers todetermine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, generalenvironmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation ofan Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibilityexists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State HistoricPreservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed asendangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to thesurvival and recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-StevensFishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of 0.7 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally\f-3managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicablewater quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water QualityCertifications, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearingbe held to consider this application.
