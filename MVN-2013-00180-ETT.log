As proposed the project would install +40,000 cubic yards of rockrip-rap material along approximately 2 linear miles of shoreline and construct a sheet pile bulkhead along800 linear feet of shoreline. The project would dredge +102,300 cubic yards of native materials from +47acres of bottoms to access the area were the rip-rap will be placed. Those dredged materials would bedischarged into + 25.5 acres of bottoms located shoreward of the rip-rap and bulkhead structures. Allproposed work is located within non-vegetated tidal bottoms of the Barataria Waterway. No impacts towetlands are proposed and no mitigation is proposed.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Writtencomments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasonsthereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and mustbe mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period.

The application forthis proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and may beexamined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment ofcosts of reproductionThe applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies withand will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. TheDepartment of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver ofthe Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.\f3The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of HistoricPlaces at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage ordestroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of thisnotice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.The Corps is unaware of any Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species that may occur in theproject area. Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any ESA listed species noraffect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any ESA listed species.This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in temporary impacts to +47 acres of EFHand long term impacts to +25.5 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum, blue crab andpenaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action may have an adverse impact on EFHor federally managed fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impactsand the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NMFS.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
