Theunauthorized material was existing upon acquisition of the subject property by the applicant and appeared tohave been deposited between 1998 and 2006. The applicant also proposes to excavate and redeposit fill toperform land reclamation for personal recreational uses, deposit fill for bankline stabilization, excavatematerial for access, and deposit fill for marsh restoration efforts. Proposed impacts include: (1) prior filling of0.76 acres of jurisdictional herbaceous wetlands and 0.08 acres of jurisdictional Waters of the US for theexisting residential home site, (2) excavating approximately 0.24 acres of tidal marsh and 5.02 acres of openwater area for material and construction access, (3) filling 5.79 acres of shallow open water with rip-rap andwaterbottom material for land reclamation and bank stabilization,(4) and filling 2.18 acres of shallow openwater for marsh restoration. The applicant has proposed the on-site marsh restoration efforts as compensatorymitigation for their project related impacts.\fThe applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the site to pre-project conditions ifissuance of a permit is determined to be contrary to the public interest.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.
