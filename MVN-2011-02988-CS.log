That decision will reflect the nationalconcern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may beexpected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factorswhich may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among thoseare conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish andwildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts ofthis proposed activity.

The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of 0.25 acre of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
