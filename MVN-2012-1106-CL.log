The re-route of New River willrequire the excavation of approximately 10,560 cubic yards of earthen material for a 35-foot wide channelmeasuring13,068 linear feet in length. A 10-foot wide riparian buffer will be created on either side of the re-routed channel. Approximately 1,320 linear feet of the existing New River will be filled with 10,560 cubicyards of material excavated from the re-route and will impact 1.4 acres of riparian wetlands on each side of thechannel. The re-route of New River will also require the placement of two 60-inch reinforced concrete culverts.One culvert will be placed at the proposed heavy haul road crossing and the other will be placed at the proposedrailroad crossing, as shown on the attached drawings.A temporary barge landing and heavy haul road will be constructed from the Mississippi River and across thelevee.
