The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0 acre(s) ofEFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed actionwould not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
