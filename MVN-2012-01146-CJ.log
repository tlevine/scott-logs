All factorswhich may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among thoseare conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish andwildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts ofthis proposed activity.

The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluationof the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicablewater quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, before a permit isissued.\f-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a publichearing be held to consider this application.
