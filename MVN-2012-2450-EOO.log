For back levee repairs, the permittee proposed to repair and maintain twenty dewateringlevee cuts and scour locations. Hauled in fill material is to be placed in 12 inch lifts and compacted to 90% asstated in the District’s Levee Permit Policy. In areas with minor erosion and scour: clearing, grubbing,cleaning, and re-depositing of material is to take place on the top 12-inches of the levee. In total, 132,000 cubicyards of material will be deposited for levee repairs and 12,000 cubic yards of material will be excavated as partof the cleaning in minor scour areas. The debris removal area includes storm generated material on the leveeROW and submerged debris within the drainage canal on the protected side of the levee. Mechanized landclearing, filling, or tracking for access, staging, and/or implementation is limited to within the levee ROW.
