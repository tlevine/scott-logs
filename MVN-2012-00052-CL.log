Theproject design has since been modiﬁed to alleviate navigation concerns presented in response to the publicnotice. The new design will require additional impacts to batture wetlands for a temporary crane pad and leveecrossing road.Install and maintain an extension to the existing marine terminal to serve the existing adjacent facility.The work will include installing a ship loader dock, mooring dolphins, a crane pad and an access road crossingthe levee. All proposed structures will extend no further than 513 feet channelward from the existing levee toe,as shown on the drawings. This will require clearing, impacting approximately 0.7 acre of jurisdictionalwetlands. The applicant has proposed to purchase compensatory mitigation from a Corps approved mitigationbank within the watershed to fulﬁll the mitigation requirement.","locationOfWork":"LOCATION OF WORK: In the Mississippi River, left descending bank, at a point 161.3 miles above Head ofPasses, in Convent, Louisiana, in St. James Parish, as shown in enclosed drawings."}
