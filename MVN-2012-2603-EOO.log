Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency.
