The project is proposed as two options: one is a rockrevetment and foreshore dike which will consist of excavating and temporarily stockpiling 188,000 cubicyards of water bottom sediments to provide an access channel needed to transport 88,700 cubic yards ofrip-rap which is to be strategically placed along the shoreline of Bayou Sale Bay and Atchafalaya Bay.The proposed work would occur approximately parallel to the mean high water shoreline, the outermostedge to extend approximately 200 feet bayward therefrom.
