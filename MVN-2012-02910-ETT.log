That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the\f3impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of HistoricPlaces at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage ordestroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of thisnotice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.The Corps is unaware of any Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species that may occur in theproject area. Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any ESA listed species noraffect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any ESA listed species.This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in temporary impacts to +127 acres ofEFH and permanent impacts to +9 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum, blue crab andpenaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action may have an adverse impact on EFHor federally managed fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impactsand the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NMFS.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.

Copies of thisnotice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.The Corps is unaware of any Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species that may occur in theproject area. Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any ESA listed species noraffect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any ESA listed species.This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in temporary impacts to +127 acres ofEFH and permanent impacts to +9 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum, blue crab andpenaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action may have an adverse impact on EFHor federally managed fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impactsand the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NMFS.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.

The dredge spoil materials would betemporarily side cast into +14 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms along the access channel.\f2Five different types of non-rock shoreline protection structures will be installed at each location,as part of the “Non-Rock Alternatives to Shoreline Protection” CWPPRA demonstration projects. Thefive structures vary in design and are constructed from various combinations of: concrete-formedmaterials, steel support pilings, high density polyethylene materials, fiberglass support pilings and PVCpipe materials. No permanent wetland impacts are proposed and no mitigation is proposed.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.
