Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluationof the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicablewater quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office ofEnvironmental Services before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a publichearing be held to consider this application.
