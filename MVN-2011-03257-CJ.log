Approximately 80 cubic yards of sand materialwould be hauled in and deposited to achieve required grade elevation requirements. The excavatedand graded material will remain in situ for the slope formation and stone blanket foundation. Theproposed project is situated on an approximately 0.52-acre tract that has been determined to be nonwetlands. Of this, approximately 0.11 of an acre would be used in construction of the bulkhead.The remainder of the property will be left in its natural state. It is anticipated that the proposedaction would have no impact to wetlands.The applicant has designed the project to avoid and minimize direct and secondary adverse impactsto the maximum extent practicable.\f2The comment period for the Department of Army will close in 20 days from the date of this jointpublic notice.

All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will beconsidered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of thepeople.The US Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, andlocal agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider andevaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by theUS Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit forthis proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factorslisted above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or anEnvironmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Commentsare also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interestof the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.

The applicant's proposal wouldresult in the destruction or alteration of up to n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of reddrum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have asubstantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our finaldetermination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to reviewby and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, theevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposedactivity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department ofEnvironmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
