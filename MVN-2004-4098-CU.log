Approximately 34 cubic yards of material will be deposited in revetment areas. The proposed work is tobe located within an area about 3,600 feet long and 315 feet wide, extending lengthwise approximately parallel to theordinary high water line, as shown on the drawings. The proposed project has no impact on wetlands.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental QualityWQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions formodifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interestin this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the commentperiod. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the PermitApplication Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORYBRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQCApplication number and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and maybe examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs ofreproduction.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulativeimpacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection\fand utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal mustbe balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will beconsidered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, generalenvironmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety,food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare ofthe people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies andofficials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangeredspecies, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statementpursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearingand to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists thatthe proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, ordata. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of anyendangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of0acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that theproposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf ofMexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review byand coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probableimpacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be requiredfrom the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Service, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held toconsider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a publichearing.The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be conductedin a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program.
