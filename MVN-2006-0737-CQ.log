That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal.

Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuantto the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.

The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of NA acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impacton EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to projectimpacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NationalMarine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the\fevaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by theAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activitywill not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of EnvironmentalQuality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that apublic hearing be held to consider this application.
