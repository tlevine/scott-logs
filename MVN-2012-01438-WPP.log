That decision will reflect thenational concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonablymay be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeabledetriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulativeeffects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate theimpacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To makethis decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, waterquality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are usedin the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant tothe National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a publichearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. Thepossibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the StateArcheologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered bythe U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survivaland recovery of any endangered species.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in thedestruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeidshrimp.
