The applicant is proposing to modify the project with the following changes:1. Relocation of the equipment access route to the Empire Waterway. No additional dredging or dischargefill will result.2. Realignment of 20,000 feet of access channel and temporary disposal resulting in up to 106,215 cubicyards of additional dredging and disposal and a 57-acre increase in impacts to un-vegetatedwaterbottoms.3. Increase of an additional 18,902 cubic yards of sand fill at the closure structures within the authorizedproject area.4. Removal of 37 existing timber piles for construction access. No additional dredging is anticipated andthe work takes place in the authorized access channel.5. Removal of 3,400 feet of abandoned/orphaned flow lines within the limits of currently authorized work.Flowline removal activities would occur within the earthen ridge, containment dike, and marsh creationareas. No additional dredging or discharge of fill material is proposed with these activities.\f-2The modification is illustrated on sheets 2, 4, 5, and 6 of the drawings. This action falls under the CoastalWetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act or CWPPRA project BA-68 and has been designed toprovide a net benefit of 370 acres though the project’s 20 year design life. No additional compensatorymitigation measures have been proposed with this project at this time.The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are beingsolicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to bereceived before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permitapplication must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corpsof Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerningthe Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application numberand be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above. Individualsor parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to theproject manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received bythis office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request andthe requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the timeextension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period,will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Qualityand may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained uponpayment of costs of reproduction.Corps of Engineers Permit CriteriaThe decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, includingcumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the nationalconcern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may beexpected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. Allfactors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historicproperties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion andaccretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiberproduction, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of thepeople.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agenciesand officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of thisproposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers todetermine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, generalenvironmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation ofan Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibilityexists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,\f-3historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State HistoricPreservation Officer.The previous review determined that the proposed work may impact the Gulf sturgeon (Acipenseroxyrinchus Desotoi) and five species of sea turtles: green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelysimpricata), Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii), leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and loggerhead (Carettacaretta). Our initial finding was that the work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect (NLAA) these species and/ortheir critical habitat. On March 16, 2012, NMFS responded to the Corps request for NLAA concurrence withthe project-effect determinations under Section 7 of ESA. NMFS analyzed the potential effects of the projectand the five ESA-listed species of sea turtles and the threatened Gulf Sturgeon and concurred with the NLAAprovided NMFS’ Sea Turtle and Smalltooth Sawfish Construction Conditions were included with theauthorization.This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-StevensFishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction oralteration of 117.0 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency.

To make this decision,comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, generalenvironmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation ofan Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.

Our initialdetermination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federallymanaged fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need formitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation ofthe probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency.
