This proposed project increment includes the reestablishment of the eroded headland/beach through the creation of a continuous beach and dune systemfor approx. 38,500 linear feet of shoreline (±448 acres of beach and dune habitat) on the CaminadaHeadland from Bayou Moreau eastward to Caminada Pass. The dune will be omitted along theeasternmost ±8,500 feet due to the presence of healthy dune habitat. Up to approx. 6,100,000 cu. yds. ofsand will be mined from the South Pelto borrow area, and then transported via hopper dredge and/or scowbarges to a proposed pump-out area (1,500’ x 1,500’). This pump-out area, located approx. 11,000 feetoffshore in the Gulf and designated as Offshore No. 3 Pump-Out Area, will allow the temporaryplacement of sand mined from offshore. A conveyance corridor will be established to lay an ±11,000-footpipeline that will transport sand material from this offshore pump-out area to the headland and beach/dunefill template.

This proposed project increment includes the reestablishment of the eroded headland/beach through the creation of a continuous beach and dune systemfor approx. 38,500 linear feet of shoreline (±448 acres of beach and dune habitat) on the CaminadaHeadland from Bayou Moreau eastward to Caminada Pass. The dune will be omitted along theeasternmost ±8,500 feet due to the presence of healthy dune habitat. Up to approx. 6,100,000 cu. yds. ofsand will be mined from the South Pelto borrow area, and then transported via hopper dredge and/or scowbarges to a proposed pump-out area (1,500’ x 1,500’). This pump-out area, located approx. 11,000 feetoffshore in the Gulf and designated as Offshore No. 3 Pump-Out Area, will allow the temporaryplacement of sand mined from offshore. A conveyance corridor will be established to lay an ±11,000-footpipeline that will transport sand material from this offshore pump-out area to the headland and beach/dunefill template.
