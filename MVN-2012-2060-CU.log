That decision will reflect the nationalconcern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may beexpected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factorswhich may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among thoseare conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish andwildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and localagencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts ofthis proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers todetermine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, generalenvironmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation ofan Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determinethe overall public interest of the proposed activity.No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
